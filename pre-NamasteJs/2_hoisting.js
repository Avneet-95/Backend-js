console.log(getName());
// console.log(x);

let x=7;

function getName(){
    console.log("namaste js");
}
// if we use getName as arrow function then it will behave like other variable and give undefined while hoisting

// hoisting is phenomena in js by which you can access variables and functions even before they are declared
